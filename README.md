BetterChecker is an open-source **PowerShell** tool for verifying the integrity of a player’s setup in **Tom Clancy’s Rainbow Six Siege**.  
It’s designed for streamers, YouTubers, and other trusted individuals to have a suspected player run the script to check for common cheats, injectors, or unfair modifications.

## 📝 Overview

- **Purpose-built for Rainbow Six Siege**  
  Scans for widely known cheats, injectors, or suspicious modifications.
- **Transparent & Safe**  
  Originally inspired by a closed-source script with questionable code.  
  BetterChecker was rebuilt from scratch to be open source, auditable, and safe to run.
- **Easy to Run**  
  Delivered as a single PowerShell script that can be executed via a one-liner.

## ✨ Features

- Detects common cheat tools and modifications.
- Lightweight and fast — minimal system impact.
- Fully open source for transparency.
- Updated to detect more cheat vectors.

## 🚀 Running BetterChecker

You can run BetterChecker directly with a one-liner in PowerShell.  

### Run with a single command

```powershell
iex(iwr("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Annabxlla/BetterChecker/refs/heads/master/main.ps1"))
```

*(This downloads and executes the latest `main.ps1` from GitHub.)*

Or, if you prefer to download and inspect first:

### Download and inspect manually

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/Annabxlla/BetterChecker/
cd BetterChecker
```

### After running

The script will perform checks and output a report indicating any detected suspicious files, processes, or configurations.

## 🛡️ Intended Use

BetterChecker is meant for **legitimate, non-malicious verification** by trusted parties (streamers, content creators, competitive players).  
It is **not** an anti-cheat system and does not provide real-time enforcement.
